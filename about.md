I'm Andres Rodriguez, a deep learning researcher with applications to computer vision. The purpose of this blog is to post important discoveries/events that are happening in the deep learning community and summarize existing techniques. I will also post mini-tutorials or helpful commands or reusable code related to blogging, linux, or coding.
